Phase 1: Initial Setup & Research

        1. Market Research & Competitive Analysis
                - Study existing platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) focusing on their recommendation systems.
                - Analyze user behavior patterns and preferences, particularly in the context of mood-based listening.
        2. Define Core Features & User Scenarios
                - Mood-based Playlist Creation: Allow users to select songs based on moods like "Energy Boost," "Relaxation," etc.
                - Explicit Input Recognition: Incorporate scenarios where users can explicitly tell the platform what they want (e.g., "I'm feeling low; play something uplifting").
        3. User Profile Setup: Create user profiles based on listening history, preferences, and explicit mood inputs.
                - Technical Stack Selection
                - Backend: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js
                - Frontend: React.js, Next.js
                - Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
                - AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
                - Cloud Hosting: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

                
Phase 2: Architecture & Design
        
        1. Database Design
                - User profiles, song metadata, mood labels, listening history.
                - Integration with external APIs like Spotify for song metadata.
        2. API Development
                - Set up API endpoints for user authentication, song retrieval, mood classification, and recommendation.
        3. Mood Detection Algorithm
                - Develop algorithms to categorize songs based on mood (e.g., energetic, calm).
                - Use existing datasets or manually label data for training models.
        4. Frontend Design
                - Create wireframes and mockups.
                - Design a user-friendly interface for mood selection and explicit song requests.


Phase 3: Development
        
        1. Backend Development
                - Implement core functionalities (user authentication, profile management, mood-based playlist creation).
                - Integrate the Spotify API for song metadata retrieval.
        2. Frontend Development
                - Develop the mood selector and playlist interfaces.
                - Implement real-time song recommendations based on user inputs and moods.
        3. Recommendation Engine
                - Build and integrate the recommendation engine using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and mood-based algorithms.
                - Personalize recommendations based on the time of day, activity, and user behavior.


Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
        
        1. Unit Testing & Integration Testing
                - Test individual components and their integration.
                - Ensure mood-based recommendations align with user expectations.
        2. Performance Optimization
                - Optimize database queries and API responses.
                - Fine-tune the recommendation algorithms for speed and accuracy.
        3. User Feedback & Iteration
                - Conduct beta testing with a small user base.
                - Gather feedback on mood-based recommendations and UI/UX.
                - Iterate on features and algorithms based on user feedback.
